# ============================================================================
# SheJane / 石间 — developer & ops command surface.
#
#   make            → grouped help (this is the default goal)
#   make ci         → run everything CI runs, locally
#   make dev / restart-runtime → run the full stack / restart Runtime only
#   make release COMPONENT=client VERSION=X.Y.Z → push client-vX.Y.Z
#
# Targets are grouped with `##@ Section` headers and self-document via the
# `## description` after each name — `make help` parses those. Keep new
# targets annotated so they show up.
