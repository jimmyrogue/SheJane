# Produces a self-contained ONEDIR bundle (dist/shejane-runtime/) that runs WITHOUT a
# system Python — it's what the Electron desktop app spawns. Build it with
# `make package-runtime` (= `uv run pyinstaller shejane-runtime.spec`).
#
# onedir (not onefile) on purpose: onefile re-extracts to a temp dir on every
# launch (slow + AV re-scan) and breaks uvicorn's signal handling; onedir starts
# fast and lets each inner binary be code-signed individually (needed for macOS
# notarization in a later phase).
