# OCR plugin

The OCR plugin recognizes text in an ordered batch of explicitly selected images.
It uses only the exact `org.rapidocr.runtime` asset declared in its installed
manifest: RapidOCR 3.9.1, PP-OCRv6 medium detection/recognition models, ONNX Runtime,
and the CPU execution provider.

The plugin does not download models, switch providers, call a vision model, or fall
back to platform OCR. PDF OCR is an explicit composition: render selected pages with
the PDF plugin, then pass those same-Run PNG Artifact IDs to this plugin.

`build_package.py` creates a deterministic platform-specific `.shejane-plugin`
archive from a PyInstaller onedir Worker and an exact Runtime Asset digest. The
SheJane-maintained package is executed by the fixed OCR host adapter; arbitrary
third-party packages cannot select that adapter. This keeps the general Managed
Worker release gate closed while allowing the trusted native OCR capability on
macOS arm64 and Windows AMD64.

Windows artifacts are produced only on a Windows AMD64 runner because PyInstaller
does not cross-compile. `scripts/build-ocr-windows-amd64.ps1` fetches the exact
locked wheels and models, performs two byte-identical Runtime Asset builds, freezes
the Worker twice, packages the digest-bound plugin, and runs the real quality and
hostile-input suite before publishing either artifact.
